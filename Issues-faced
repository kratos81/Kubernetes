***** Issues ****** 

(1) * Minikube refusing to start cluster with error 

 minikube start 
Starting local Kubernetes v1.9.0 cluster...

6c4008be7492:.docker ofkenna$ kubectl get nodes 
The connection to the server 192.168.99.100:8443 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?

WORKAROUND -> from the https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/2468
- Stop , delete , reinstall 
minikube stop && minikube delete && minikube start 


(2) Docker refusing to build from Dockerfile ( hair pulling stuff!! ) 
Error 
Step 13/18 : VOLUME /var/lib/mysql
 ---> Using cache
 ---> d51d58a52cef
Step 14/18 : COPY docker-entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/
COPY failed: stat /var/lib/docker/tmp/docker-builder360415414/docker-entrypoint.

Discussion about it here -> https://forums.docker.com/t/resolved-automated-docker-build-fails/22831/32

WORKAROUND - Pull image from Docker and then push it to quay.io where they can be referenced by the imageSecret

(3) Beacuse the dockerfile would not build , I couldnt set up the triggers for the repository and link it to github

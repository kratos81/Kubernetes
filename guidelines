+++Guidelines for deployment +++++


* Dockerfiles and any supporting files for the container to be in publically accessible and well documented github/gitlab repositories.
* Containers built in quay.io and tagged
    * You can use their built-in build pipeline
    * The containers should be in private registries
    * Should have automatic build triggers
* The workflow should demonstrate a multi-tier application.Â  This can be based on something like the guestbook example app, but I expect your containers to be in quay.
* Kubernetes deployment yaml manifests should be under source control.
* A pull secret for your quay registry should be stored in kubernetes and referenced in your manifests.
* Health checks for container health as part of the manifest.
* Demonstrate a deployment, rollout update and then rollback.
* Make a visible change to your frontend container and demonstrate the full workflow.
